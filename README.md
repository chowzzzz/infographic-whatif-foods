#### 🥇 _Won Newcomer Award for NUS CREATION Design Competition 2021_ 🥇

Designed and created an infographic for the NUS CREATION Design Competition 2021 for the company WhatIF Foods targeted with bringing their self created, healthy instant noodles to the public 🍜. Had a very enjoyable experience designing this infographic as it allowed me to challenge myself to use Adobe Photoshop, as I was always accustomed in using Adobe Illustrator. 👩‍🎨

Also, got to try WhatIF Foods delicious and super healthy instant noodles made with Moringa Leaves and Bambara Nuts! 😋 Do check out their website [here](https://whatif-foods.com/) to see how they attempt to use technology and innovation to tackle social issues 🌏.
